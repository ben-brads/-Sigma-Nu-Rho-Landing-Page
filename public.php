<div class="intro">
    <p class=".uk-text-small introduction">With 2,430 members since our local founding in 1886, Rho Chapter of Sigma Nu Fraternity has an extensive history at the University of Missouri. Our core values are love, honor, and truth, and our vision is excelling with honor. Fundamentally, we emphasize our commitment to academic excellence and leadership development. Our Chapter prepares its members for a successful and enjoyable college experience and forms bonds that last long after graduation.</p>

    <p class=".uk-text-small history">
        Sigma Nu was founded by three cadets at the Virginia Military Institute during the Reconstruction period after The Civil War. The system of physical abuse and hazing of underclassmen at VMI inspired James Frank Hopkins, Greenfield Quarles, and James McIlvaine Riley to form the “Legion of Honor,” or Sigma Nu; a radical departure from the times.
    </p>
    <br/> 
  
    <p class=".uk-text-small history">
        Over the past 140+ years, Sigma Nu has grown into one of the largest fraternal organizations in the world. Over 230,000 men have been initiated into Sigma Nu from over 275 chapters all over the United States and Canada.

    <p class=".uk-text-small history">
        Rho Chapter was the sixteenth charter granted by Sigma Nu, the eleventh oldest active Sigma Nu chapter, and the second fraternity at the University of Missouri Columbia. George R. McVey traveled to Columbia in the first week of January 1886 with the expressed intent of forming a new chapter. John A. Howard financed McVey’s trip and later provided the charter for the chapter.
    </p>
    <br/> 
    <img src="images/academics.jpg" class="historyImg" alt="academics">
    <p class=".uk-text-small history">
        George McVey met with the five charter members: John M. Evans, P1; Julian H. Pearson, P2; George L. Belcher, P3; Robert E. Downing, P4; and William D. Magruder, P5. Because of opposition to “secret societies” by the faculty and a possible outright ban of them, the group decided to wait a bit longer before officially forming the chapter. The faculty, later that month, decided not to ban these “secret societies.” McVey returned to Columbia to initiate the members and start the chapter.
    </p>
    <br/> 
    
    <p class=".uk-text-small history">
        On January 26, 1886 the first five members of Rho Chapter were initiated. While the group still felt some hesitation about revealing their actions, the five charter members and McVey decide to parade down Broadway wearing the badge of the fraternity to show their commitment to Sigma Nu. Thus began Rho Chapter’s glorious history.

        Plans for a new, permanent chapter house began circulating in the early 1900s, with construction for the new house starting in 1914. Rho’s chapter house at 710 South College Avenue was completed in 1915. The sunroom addition was completed in 1921. In 1962, Rho alumni funded a significant renovation and addition that doubled the size of the original house, adding more rooms, bathrooms, and a dining room to the rear of the house.
    </p>
    <br/>
  
    <p class=".uk-text-small history">
        After 101 years at 710 South College and the house showing its age, the alumni of Rho Chapter embarked on a campaign to construct a new chapter house in 2014. Construction was started in 2016 and was completed in August of 2017.
